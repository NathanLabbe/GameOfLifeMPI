# GameOfLifeMPI
Lab for the PPAR Parallel Programming course at [Université de Rennes 1](https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/).

## Principle

The objective of this lab assignment is to implement a sequential version, and a parallel of the [Conway’s Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) with [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface)(Message Passing Interface)
We also improve the MPI version by shortening the messages send with MPI from N to 2N/sizeof(unsigned int)
